I am a seasoned DevOps/SRE professional with decades of experience including
backend software development.

Can single-handedly build and manage a well-architected, secure,
high-performing, resilient and cost-effective infrastructure for a
small/medium-scale web application. Fully automated infrastructure as code,
automated testing and deployment pipelines, container orchestration, monitoring
and observability, cost management, source code repository management etc.

Not afraid of taking on a legacy project and carefully reshaping it into a
properly managed infrastructure without downtime and outages.
